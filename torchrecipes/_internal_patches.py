If you change the symbols exported in this file, you very likely want to change
the symbols expoerted in ./fb/_internal_patches.py as well.

For any buck-based build internally (within fbcode), this file is silently
replaced with the file located in ./fb/_internal_patches.py. This is to enable
use to silenetly swap out symbols (such as Checkpoint, Logger, etc.) between
internal-only implementations and external versions w/o requiring user involvement.
